## About
Friendly Plans is an application supporting autism treatment.
It provides digital version of activity schedules. More about treatment (ENG): [PCDI website](http://www.pcdi.org/resources/videos.html)

The app is being used by group of users and therapists. Everyone can download it (version 1.x) from [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.przyjaznydamianek&hl=pl).
