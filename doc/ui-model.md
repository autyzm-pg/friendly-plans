# UI model
Clickable UI model is available in moqups service:
[UI model](https://app.moqups.com/mikolevy2/tGR3mQdS/view/page/aa26d9cf5)
It's editable but account owner (mikolevy) must add moqups collaborators manually by an email.
That service has serious limitations for free accounts, so we're planning move it to another service, in the future (after we obtain needed license for open source).
This UI model shows rather features than actual UX design concept.
